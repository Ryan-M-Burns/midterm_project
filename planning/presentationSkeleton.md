# PRESENTATION SKELETON
1. Introduction:  Who we are, our backgrounds
2. Introduce Omit the Plates, why we chose it, and general workflow, we chose to make this a 1 page app to challenge ourselves since being in a two person group wasn't challenge enough. 
3. Demo: scenario:
  - Two friends ordering for a small dinner party
  - add some appies, add some entrees, variety, scroll through the menu, add some drinks
  - realize we are way over budget and remove some stuff

4. reflections
  - gitworkflow - proper use of branches and pull requests
                - how to pull and marge to find conflicts with your local version

  - single page app was maybe not the way to go without the right framework in place
  - once the database was in place, I should have paused on styling and got the website fully functional before polishing off little details
  - We should have spent a bit more time in planning and both having a better understanding of the end product, what database queries were needed, and what data we wanted to pass back and forth between the front and back end
